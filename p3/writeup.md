## Project: Perception Pick & Place

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it!

### Exercise 1, 2 and 3 pipeline implemented
Exercise 1: implement RANSAC.py. RANSA is a algorithm that can fit points to a known model. In this project, it is used to filter the table, which is described by a plan model. A voxel grid filter is first used to downsample the input data, and a pass-through filter is used to cut the non-intrested volume. Finally, the RANSA algorithm is used with a plan model (SACMODEL_PLANE), where parameter `max_distance` is used to control the poits that are included in the plane model.


#### 1. Complete Exercise 1 steps. Pipeline for filtering and RANSAC plane fitting implemented.

#### 2. Complete Exercise 2 steps: Pipeline including clustering for segmentation implemented.  

#### 2. Complete Exercise 3 Steps.  Features extracted and SVM trained.  Object recognition implemented.
Here is an example of how to include an image in your writeup.

### Pick and Place Setup

#### 1. For all three tabletop setups (`test*.world`), perform object recognition, then read in respective pick list (`pick_list_*.yaml`). Next construct the messages that would comprise a valid `PickPlace` request output them to `.yaml` format.

And here's another image!

Spend some time at the end to discuss your code, what techniques you used, what worked and why, where the implementation might fail and how you might improve it if you were going to pursue this project further.
